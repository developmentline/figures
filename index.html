                Welcome to Figures!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here you can become a painter, although right now you'll only be able to paint a couple of geometric figures, it'll still be fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you see that big white box in the middle of the page? that is the <b>Drawing Area.</b> There you can do all the hard work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alright, now take a look at the small white box with the two green buttons. That is the <b>Notebook</b>, it'll keep track of your work for you so you don't miss anything.
            </p>

            <p>Good! guess we are ready for some painting.</p>

            <p>
                The first thing you can do in the <b>Drawing Area.</b> is to paint a circle, and even when you are wondering where is the paint and the brush and all that stuff, you shall not worry. We will take care of all the paperwork. Just bare with me and click on any place inside of the <b>Drawing Area</b>... you will see a red circle, awesome!.
            </p>

            <p>
                That was good, yet not enough. We want to be real painters. So let's go further and paint something bigger.
            </p>

            <p>Click again anywhere you want inside the <b>Drawing Area</b>. As expected, another red circle will appear. By now you'll probably notice that there is some information in the <b>NoteBook</b> and even though when that looks so weird, it is useful. The <b>NoteBook</b> is recording each click and is saving it as a <b>Point</b>, storing the location of the <b>Point</b> as a coordinate (x, y).</p>

            <p>Ok, now let's do the final touch. Click again anywhere inside the <b>Drawing Area</b>. I know, that does not sound very exiting.... but Surprise!</p>

            <p>That looks better, right?</p>

            <p>A Circle and a Parallelogram has been drawn!.</p>

            <p>Notice how the <b>NoteBook</b> has some extra information. Let's go through it and figure out what it means.</p>

            <p>At first it stored the location of the third <b>Point,</b> Just as expected, but it also added two more lines: The Parallelogram's area and the Circle's area, and notice that their values are the same. Both figures have the same area, but also they share its center of mass. That is why they are so close toghether.</p>

            <p>Well, there you go. A full Figures Painting.</p>

            <p>And if you are thinking that you ain't did nothing. Here is your chance.</p>

            <p>From now on you can adjust/redraw the Figures as you wish. just click and hold on any of the three <b>Points</b> to drag them any where you want inside the drawing area.</p>

            <p>You can create awesome shapes that way.</p>

            <p>Alright, just one more thing... Remember that there are two green buttons in the <b>NoteBook</b>, the <b>About</b> button, that will show/hide this panel, and the <b>Reset</b> button, that will clear all and will allow you to start over.</p>

            <p>Happy Painting!</p>
